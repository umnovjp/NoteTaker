# NoteTaker
## Routes
Two HTML routes and two API routes are created. This is an example of GET HTML route:

And as bonus suggests, I created DELETE route, which works in Insomnia (does not work in HTML yet). I hope it still counts as A+. Let me show you DELETE example. When I hit this route in Insomnia

it DELETEs element with that id from an array. Compare two arrays in terminal. And check that objects do have unique id

## Requirements
When I open the Note Taker I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page

When I click on the link to the notes page I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

When I enter a new note title and the note’s text a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page

When I click on the Save icon the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes. When I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column that note appears in the right-hand column: this function does not work yet. When I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
